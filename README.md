# Miau Utils üêæ: A Rust Coreutils Rewrite ü¶Ä

This project, named Miau Utils, is an ambitious, from-scratch rewrite of the essential Unix core utilities (like ls, cat, wc, cp, etc.) in the Rust programming language.

## Inspiration and Goal

This project is inspired by the excellent work of the [uutils project](https://github.com/uutils/) and the growing trend toward using Rust for critical infrastructure, such as Ubuntu's adoption of Rust-based coreutils.

I also want to gain a deep, practical understanding of advanced Rust concepts, including traits, I/O handling, error management, and performance optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust

OR

- NixOS/Nix (optionally with `direnv`): If you use Nix, a `flake.nix` is provided to instantly set up the development environment.

### Building

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/gamersekofy/miauutils.git
cd miauutils
```

2. Environment Setup (NixOS Users):

```
nix develop
# OR
direnv allow
```

3. Build the entire Miau Utils workspace:

```
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binaries will be located in `target/release/`.

## Progress Tracker

This section tracks the implementation status of each utility in the Miau Utils suite, categorized by function.
